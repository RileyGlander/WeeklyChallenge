# Weekly Challenge 1

## Description

- What was your motivation? What motivated me was knowing that I could try out different commands and find something that I like. It was super interesting to be able to do that and figure stuff out as I go. 
- Why did you build this project? I built this project to help myself get a better understanding of the majority of commands. This was a great way to test out different things and customize the site a little more to my liking.
- What problem does it solve? This project didn't solve any problems.
- What did you learn? I learned that there are so many commands to try, especially ones I haven't before. It is a learning process with much to remember but it is a skill that will become more familiar as I keep practicing.
